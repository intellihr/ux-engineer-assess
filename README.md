# Analytics Team Assessment for UX Engineer

## Employee Data Visualization App

### Problem Description

`ABC` company kept their employee data in a small csv file (`./data/employee.csv`),
and the HR manager had to use excel like spread sheet app to manually do some number crunching
every time when the boss want to get some insights from the data.

Some of these questions the business want to know about are like:

1. what are the headcount for different gender type, work classes, age groups and business units?

2. what's the age distribution like for different gender type, work classes, etc.?

3. what's the headcount trend over time like for different gender type, work classes, etc.?


The HR manager normally spend more than 5 hours to create a report for the business to answer above question using excel spread sheet. Recently, the manager finally fed up with the manual task and decide to ask for your help to build a cool tool/app that can be used to answer the above problems with their dataset.


### Assessment Criteria

1. The HR manager is not very tech savvy and has a strong art/design background.
Hence, it is important that the solution need to be:
  - User friendly. That is, people don't need much training or knowledge to use the app effectively.
  - The app need to be visually pleasant and attractive.

2. Completeness of the solution. It is not essential for the result solution to address all of the three
questions listed above, however, a more completed solution is always better.

3. Mobile friendly (Bonus). It would be awesome if the app can be used with mobile device.

4. There are no limitation or constraint on how this tool should be developed.
However, as engineering capability is also an essential criteria for this role, it would be advantageous
if the technical stacks employed involve some of the following:

- javascript
- typescript
- React
- d3.js
- python
